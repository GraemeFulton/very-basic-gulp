## Running your first tasks

Take a look at `package.json`, and you'll see two npm packages have been added since the first lesson:

1. gulp-sass
2. autoprefixer

###Gulp-sass
A task has been added to the gulpfile.js to compile the SCSS file to CSS

###auto prefixing
this saves you developmnet time in prefixing css rules for different browsers.
