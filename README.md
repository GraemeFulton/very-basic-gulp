Front-end development isn’t just about writing code, but also being flexible in the way you work. It’s important to have a development environment that supports making fast alterations when designs can change quickly.

Optimizing your workflow can help here by reducing overhead when writing code, saving you time. Also, using build tools to take control of mundane tasks and complexities in the development process without your input can reduce human errors and allow you to focus on creating.
